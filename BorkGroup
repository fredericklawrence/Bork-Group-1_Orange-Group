    This document is divided into three sections; section one is an introduction to our program and how to use this document,
    section two describes in detail the design and function of our code, listing features, case diagrams, and sequence diagrams,
    section three shows system specifications relating to design structure and file formats. 
    
1.1. System Scope: Briefly describe the system we are building.

1.2.
   Section 1. describes why we are writing this document and how it is organized.
   Section 1.1. briefly describes the system that we built.
   Section 1.2. provides descriptions of the individual sections within this document.
   Section 2. is an overall description of the functionality of our code.
   Section 2.1. lists and describes each of our supplementary features.
   Section 2.2. contains two use case write-ups and two sequence diagrams per group member. 
   Section 3. describes our system specifications and overall system design.
   Section 3.1. shows our group's UML diagrams
   Section 3.2. has examples of .bork and .sav file formats.
   
2. Overall Description:

2.1. A list and description of each of our supplementary features.
